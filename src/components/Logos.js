            I wanted to create a custom logo for the website I designed (look
            for Outdoor Burlap on my projects page) that had the elements the
            client wanted and was eye catching. Here is the original sketch. The
            arrows symbolize reduce, reuse, recycle, while the colors and design
            aim to convey the passion for this idea to clean up the trails in
            the Pacific Northwest.

            Taking a design from my grandfatherâ€™s original idea for the family
            property, I designed this logo to go with a website to let family
            and friends rent spaces at the property. I spent a lot of my
            childhood here, so I wanted to logo to include not only the
            landscape that I love, but the feeling of fun and the great
            outdoors.
